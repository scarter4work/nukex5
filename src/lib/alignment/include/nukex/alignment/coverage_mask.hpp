/// `warp` leaves 0 outside the source's coverage, and 0 is a legal pixel
/// value, so nothing downstream can tell a measurement of darkness from an
/// absence of data. The stacker therefore averaged absent samples in as
/// though they were black. Measured on a 53-frame M3 stack: 268,802
/// exactly-zero pixels, a rim at 48.6% of interior brightness, and
/// contamination reaching 48 px deep -- the session's dither and drift
/// excursion.
///
/// The mask is per CHANNEL, not per frame, because channel registration can
/// push one colour plane off the source while the others stay on it.
///
/// Storage is one bit per pixel per channel: a 6072x4042 three-channel frame
/// costs 9.2 MB here against 294 MB for a byte-per-pixel mask, and this
/// allocation sits beside a voxel cube already measured in gigabytes.
