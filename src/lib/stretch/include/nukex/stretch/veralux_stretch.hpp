/// VeraLux HyperMetric Stretch (HMS) — Paterniti 2025.
///
/// An arcsinh-based stretch with color vector preservation and
/// convergence-to-white for saturated bright sources. The core innovation
/// is treating each RGB pixel as a 3D vector: decompose into magnitude
/// (luminance) and direction (chromaticity), stretch the magnitude, then
/// reconstruct with a convergence term that gracefully transitions bright
/// pixels toward white — mimicking physical sensor/film saturation.

    /// brightens but FLATTENS: on NGC7635 the spread between the median and
    /// the 99.9th percentile falls from 0.191 to 0.073 as log_D goes 2 -> 5.
    /// So the intensity is solved per image instead of chosen once.

    /// 0.299 -- 7.5x -- with the background still exactly on target.
