"""Transform research/qe_database_research.json -> share/qe_database.json.

The research file is keyed the way a researcher thinks: product filter names
with `passes`, cameras that inherit QE from a `sensors` block, Gr/Gb/mono_pk
photosites. The engine is keyed the way FilterClassifier + QEDatabase think:
canonical filter names ("HaO3", "L-eXtreme", ...) with emission `lines`, one
resolved QE block per camera with R/G/B (OSC) or mono_pk (mono) photosites.
This script is the only bridge between the two. It is deterministic and
refuses to write a database the engine cannot consume.

Two research-data gaps are handled explicitly rather than silently: a mono
sensor's peak QE is sometimes keyed "mono" instead of "mono_pk" (vocabulary
drift, same quantity, aliased through); an OSC camera whose sensor was only
ever researched as a flat panchromatic curve, with no Bayer-channel split at
any wavelength, is excluded from the shipped file with a note rather than
invented or shipped broken (spec 6.3's generic_sony_imx_osc fallback covers
it at runtime, with a Process Console warning). A camera with a Bayer split
at SOME wavelengths but not others is different — inconsistent data, not a
missing measurement — and still fails loud.
